## Project Structure

- **original_code/**: Contains the core automation scripts developed from scratch for managing security compliance tools.
- **refactored_code/**: Includes refactored versions of the original code to improve efficiency and readability.
- **update_scripts/**: Contains auxiliary scripts used to illustrate how the original code depends on other components or to provide context for certain operations. These scripts are not part of the core functionality but demonstrate important supporting features.

### Dependencies
The `update_scripts/` folder contains scripts that help demonstrate the functionality or dependencies required by the original code but are not the primary focus of the project. You can use these scripts to better understand the project's interactions.
